<br><br>My name is Ryuzi gu and I am a fat and   always happy boy. I was born at 25 August 2000 and I am 11 years old now!Jenny is my mom's name and she was born in 12 March 1978 in Shanghai China. She was born when China need to plant as much trees as we can. My dad was born in  21 January 1962.The hobbies that I like the best is soccer and tennis. I like to play exciting computer games and some cool gun games like CF. I believe puda so every time when I go to Japan,I need to go to where who believes puda need to go to. My roll model is my dad because  he have his own restaurant that is as big as a Earth and it is Japanese food so my roll model is my dad and I love to eat Japanese food.

  When I was born I don't,cry so my dad went to asked the nurse why don't I cry and she said that why do you want your baby to cry?Not crying is better. When I was 3 years old,I went to take an advertisement. I was terribly happy but at that time I was highly sad and nervous. I was sad because it is very early in the morning and went back home late and I am nervous because I was too small at that time and don't know why they told me to do this and that.

  The first time I went to Wei Hua kindergarten I was sad and crying,but when my mom came when school is over,I said that I want to play longer. When 10 minute past,my mom said it time to go and I said 5 more minute and so on. When I went to primary school the first time,I was crying noisily too!Now I am in grade 6,in class 6C.When I was born,I was in shanghai ,then I move to Japan. At last I came back to shanghai to study in kindergarten.

  I think the people in my family that is best to me is my dad. The second one is my mom,because my dad always lets me do what I really want to do. My mom is the second because sometimes she shout at me.
My future is to be like my dad because he is my roll model like I have said before and because my dad have a huge restaurant as big as a Earth!And I want one too!I want to live in Japan in my future because Japan have good air as good as when there is dinosaur living. And because the people there don't always say bad words and Chinese people will say it.

  If I go to other country in my future,I will still remember China, my teachers and my friends. I will never ever forget them because teachers helped me learn and friends let me have fun.
