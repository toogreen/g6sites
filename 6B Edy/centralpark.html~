			<p>Truly, the Central Park is an oasis of green in a concrete and steel jungle. Central Park is so beautiful  and much larger than you think. There are so much to see and do in Central Park: an ice skating rink, zoo, play chess and checkers, rent a boat, etc. The park is so peaceful, joggers, walkers, and horse-drawn carriages seem to coexist quite well. The carousel will be closed in the winter, but some other "must sees" were all accessible - the Alice in Wonderland statue and the Strawberry Fields memorial.</p>
