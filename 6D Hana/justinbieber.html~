<h1>ABOUT JUSTIN BIEBER</h1>

Justin Drew Bieber born March 1, 1994 is a Canadian Pop/R&B singer-songwriter, musician, and actor.
Bieber was discovered in 2008 by Scooter Braun, who came across Bieber's videos on YouTube and later became his manager.
Braun arranged for him to meet with Usher in Atlanta, Georgia, and Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG),
a joint venture between Braun and Usher, and then to a recording contract with Island Records offered by L.A. Reid.
Bieber's debut single, "One Time", was released in 2009 and peaked in the top twenty in Canada and charted in the top thirty in several international markets. 
His debut album, the seven-track EP My World, followed in November 2009, and was soon certified platinum in the United States.
He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

Bieber's first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, was released in March 2010.
It debuted at number one or within the top ten in several countries and was certified platinum in the United States.
It was preceded by the worldwide top-ten single, "Baby". The music video of "Baby" is currently ranked as the most viewed and most discussed YouTube video.
Bieber followed up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never â€“ The Remixes,
and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, that nearly matched the record for the biggest opening weekend gross for a concert-film. Bieber released his second studio album,
Under the Mistletoe, in November 2011, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Bieber has received numerous awards, including Artist of the Year at the 2010 American Music Awards, and
