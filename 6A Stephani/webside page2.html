As a literary device backstory is often employed to lend depth or verisimilitude to the main story. The dramatic revelation of secrets 
from the backstory, as a useful technique for developing a story, was recognized as far back as Aristotle, in Poetics.
Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story 
creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use in writing the main story 
and is never revealed in the main story.
<br>
Backstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition. 
It may eventually be published as a story in its own right in a prequel.
<br>
As with other fiction-writing modes, effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.

For example, Orson Scott Card observes that "If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about 
it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . ." Furthermore, "If the memory is going to prompt a 
present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event."

The background light is used to illuminate the background area of a set. The background light will also provide separation between the 
subject and the background. In the standard 4-point lighting setup, the background light is placed last and is usually placed directly 
behind the subject and pointed at the background.
<br>
In film, the background light is usually of lower intensity. More than one light could be used to light uniformly a background or 
alternatively to highlight points of interest.
<br>
In video and television, the background light is usually of similar intensity to the key light because video cameras are less capable of 
handling high-contrast ratios. In order to provide much needed separation between subject and background, the background light will have a 
color filter, blue for example, which will make the foreground pop up.

A background actor or extra is a performer in a film, television show, stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a 
nonspeaking, nonsinging or nondancing capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). War films and 
epic films  often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors. 
Likewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.
<br>
On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as "background performers", "background artists" or simply "background" while 
the term "extra" is rarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as "supernumeraries". In opera and ballet, 
they are called either "extras" or "supers".

<br>
There are several casting agencies that specialize only in background work. When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek
 out those with specific "looks" that will contribute to the ambiance desired for the film, for instance, "high school students", "affluent 
 senior citizens", etc. Casting directors may also look for background actors that possess special skills needed for the scene, such as 
 rollerblading or dancing. In addition, as background actors are often required to use their own wardrobe on the set, casting directors may 
 seek those who already possess specific costumes or props, such as police uniforms or musical instruments.
