As a literary device backstory is often employed to lend depth or verisimilitude to the main story. The dramatic revelation of secrets from the backstory, as a useful technique for developing a story, was recognized as far back as Aristotle, in Poetics. Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use in writing the main story and is never revealed in the main story.
Backstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition. It may eventually be published as a story in its own right in a prequel.
As with other fiction-writing modes, effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.

The background light is used to illuminate the background area of a set§. The background light will also provide separation between the subject 
and the background. In the standard 4-point lighting setup§, the background light is placed last and is usually placed directly behind the 
subject and pointed at the background.
<br>
In film§, the background light is usually of lower intensity. More than one light could be used to light uniformly a background or 
alternatively to highlight points of interest.
<br>
In video§ and television§, the background light is usually of similar intensity to the key light because video cameras are less capable of 
handling high-contrast ratios. In order to provide much needed separation between subject and background, the background light will have a 
color filter§, blue for example, which will make the foreground pop up.
