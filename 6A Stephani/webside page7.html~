<h1>The Background Art</h1>

<br>
For HTML documents, however, we recommend that authors specify the background for the BODY element rather than the HTML element. 
For documents whose root element is an HTML "HTML" element or an XHTML "html" element that has computed values of 'transparent' 
for 'background-color' and 'none' for 'background-image', user agents must instead use the computed value of the background properties 
from that element's first HTML "BODY" element or XHTML "body" element child when painting backgrounds for the canvas, and must not paint a 
background for that child element. Such backgrounds must also be anchored at the same point as they would be if they were painted only for 
the root element.

<br>
Intrinsic dimensions expressed as percentages must be resolved relative to the dimensions of the rectangle that establishes the coordinate system for the 'background-position' property.
<br>
If the image has one of either an intrinsic width or an intrinsic height and an intrinsic aspect ratio, then the missing dimension is calculated from the given dimension and the ratio.
