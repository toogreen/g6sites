Backgound story
<br>
A backstory, background story, or back-story (or in games, the background of a character) is the literary 
device  of a narrative history and set of facts and factors all chronologically earlier than, and related to, a narrative of primary interest. 
Generally, it is the history of characters or other elements that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Typically, 
the genres in which a backstory may be revealed include all entertainment media being significant in all literary works such as novels or short 
stories, stage or radio plays, and so also derivative media such as TV dramas and movie films. Even a purely historical work selectively 
reveals backstory to the audience, a backstory which may receive alternative creative emphasis in each rendition of a novel, play, or film, 
while each shares key elements—however differently they may be depicted and revealed—which are factors of timing, style and story 
telling art of a given media while the whole of a backstory goes to facts.

<br>
As a literary device backstory is often employed to lend depth or verisimilitude to the main story. The dramatic revelation of secrets 
from the backstory, as a useful technique for developing a story, was recognized as far back as Aristotle, in Poetics.
Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story 
creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use in writing the main story 
and is never revealed in the main story.
Backstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition. 
It may eventually be published as a story in its own right in a prequel.

<font color="#OOOOFF">Recollection is the fiction-writing mode  whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a vital 
role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning 
of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, the use of recollection is commonly used by 
authors of fiction. Recollection could be considered a subset of introspection (as a fiction-writing mode), but its role in developing 
backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.</font>

<br>
As with other fiction-writing modes, effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.
<br>
For example, Orson Scott Card observes that "If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about 
it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . ." Furthermore, "If the memory is going to prompt a 
present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event."

Backgound lighting
<br>
The background light is used to illuminate the background area of a set. The background light will also provide separation between the 
subject and the background. In the standard 4-point lighting setup, the background light is placed last and is usually placed directly 
behind the subject and pointed at the background.
<br>
In film, the background light is usually of lower intensity. More than one light could be used to light uniformly a background or 
alternatively to highlight points of interest.
<br>
In video and television, the background light is usually of similar intensity to the key light because video cameras are less capable of 
handling high-contrast ratios. In order to provide much needed separation between subject and background, the background light will have a 
color filter, blue for example, which will make the foreground pop up.

<font color="#0000FF">Backgound actor</font>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">A background actor or extra is a performer in a film, television show, stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a 
nonspeaking, nonsinging or nondancing capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). War films and 
epic films  often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors. 
Likewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.</font>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as "background performers", "background artists" or simply "background" while 
the term "extra" is rarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as "supernumeraries". In opera and ballet, 
they are called either "extras" or "supers".</font>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Casting criteria for background actors depend on the production. Becoming a background actor often requires little to no acting experience; 
punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction may figure more prominently than talent.</font>

<br>
<font color="#0000FF">There are several casting agencies that specialize only in background work. When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek
 out those with specific "looks" that will contribute to the ambiance desired for the film, for instance, "high school students", "affluent 
 senior citizens", etc. Casting directors may also look for background actors that possess special skills needed for the scene, such as 
 rollerblading or dancing. In addition, as background actors are often required to use their own wardrobe on the set, casting directors may 
 seek those who already possess specific costumes or props, such as police uniforms or musical instruments.</font>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired en masse with little formality.</font>
