Patents disclose to society how an invention is practiced, in return for the right (during a limited term) to exclude others from manufacturing, 
selling, offering for sale or using the patented invention without the patentee's permission. Patent offices deal with prior art searches in the 
context of the patent granting procedure. To assess the validity of a patent application, patent offices explore the prior art that was 
disclosed before the invention occurred (in the United StatesÂ§) or before the filing date (in the rest of the world).

Authors may specify the background of an element (i.e., its rendering surface) as either a color or an image. In terms of the box model, 
"background" refers to the background of the content, padding and border areas. Border colors and styles are set with the border properties. 
Margins are always transparent. 
<br>
Background properties are not inherited, but the parent box's background will shine through by default because of the initial 'transparent' 
value on 'background-color'.

The background of the root element becomes the background of the canvas and covers the entire canvas, anchored (for 'background-position') at 
the same point as it would be if it was painted only for the root element itself. The root element does not paint this background again.
