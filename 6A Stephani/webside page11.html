Other artists who contribute to animated cartoons, but who are not Background Artists, are layout artists 
(who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), storyboard  artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), 
character designers (who create the style and personality of each character).

Furniture music was an invention of Erik Satie  around 1920. This type of "background music" fell into oblivion when the composer died a 
few years later, and was not again executed until it was rediscovered several decades later. Typical of Furniture music are short musical 
passages, with an indefinite number of repeats.
