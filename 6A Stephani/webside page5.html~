<h1>The Background Art</h1>

Prior art (also known as state of the art§, which also has other meanings, or background art[1]), in most systems of patent§ law,[2] constitutes
 all information§ that has been made available to the public in any form before a given date that might be relevant to a patent's claims of 
 originality. If an invention§ has been described in prior art, a patent on that invention is not valid.

<br>
Information kept secret, for instance, as a trade secret§, is not usually prior art, provided that employees and others with access to the 
information are under a non-disclosure obligation. With such an obligation, the information will typically not be regarded as prior art. 
Therefore, a patent may be granted on an invention, although someone else already knew of the invention. A person who used an invention in 
secret may in some jurisdictions be able to claim "prior user rights" and thereby gain the right to continue using the invention. As a special 
exception, earlier-filed and unpublished patent applications§ do qualify as prior art as of their filing date in certain circumstances.

In order to anticipate a claim, prior art is generally expected to provide a description sufficient to inform an average worker in the field 
(or the person skilled in the art§) of some subject matter falling within the scope of the claim. Prior art must be available in some way to 
the public, and in many countries, the information needs to be recorded in a fixed form somehow. Prior art generally does not include 
unpublished work or mere conversations (though according to the European Patent Convention§, oral disclosures also form prior art—see Article 
54(2)§ EPC§). It is disputed whether traditional knowledge§ (e.g., of medical§ properties of a certain plant) constitutes prior art.
