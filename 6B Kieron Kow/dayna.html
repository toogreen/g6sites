My sister is a brat, she is very annoying. She always have to repeat everything she says. For example, she says Kieron, can i play your computer. Kieron, can i play your computer. Kieron, can i play your computer. Kieron, can i play your computer. THEN, I would say, yes, you can. Then, Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. You are welcome.
