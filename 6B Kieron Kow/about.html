	<h1>Let me give you a brief introduction of my life</h1>
	<h2>I was born in a small island off the coast of Malaysia called Singapore. Singapore is a very beautiful island  near the equator and is surrounded by coastal beaches. I used to go there every weekend and I know the beach like the back of my hand. 
My mom told me stories of me when I was young. She told me that once, when I was very young, she was feeding me, I kept on slapping the spoon out of her hand because I did not want to eat, but I accidentally missed and flipped the spoon and got head shot. I cried and cried. Waaaaah waaaah waaaaah!!! In another story I was climbing all over the couch while my ayi was ironing the clothes. I slipped and fell off the couch in a front flip on my butt., I didn't cry and I also didn't tell my ayi about it until my mom came home. She didn't blame the ayi. She also said I'm a big brave boy.
When I was in primary 1 life was painful and full of misery. I would have to do my homework ''till 9 pm then I would have to practice my spellings, by then it is already late at night and I would have to go to sleep. I'd wake at around 5:30 pm and go to school, the school is called <a href="yps.html">Yumin Primary School</a>.

Life in Shanghai is so much better-less homework, less spellings and more friends. Now I have time to actually play with my friends. But guess what I have to sleep at 8:30 pm.
I have lots of relative and if I'd name them it would be as long as earth so I would name the important ones. My favorite aunt is aunt Jiko(Malaya). She has two sons one is called Clarence and is,i think,14.lesley is one year older then me. They are gameing masters. My dad's brother,uncle gerade,macko-sister to my dad.On my mom's side. My mama(mom's mom)is called popo-chinese name, and my mapa(you guessed it),I rarely see him.My mom has two sister one is called sayan, married to uncle gary last year. Another one is called ayan, graduated last year.
I have lots of intrests, i love sports. My favourite sports is soccer.My favourite subject in school is science. I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate biology. I am also a socond place gaming master.

Ops, i forgot to introduce my sister. Her name is <a href="dayna.html">dayna</a>. She is super annoying, supercry baby and super nosy. She is 7 years old and is in this school. She is in class 2A
in the future I will work for discovery channel and play a part in Man VS Wild, survive 2012 and retire in the carabeans.</h2>
