   <p>Iron Man is a fictional character, a superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created
    by writer-editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. 
    He made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963).

A billionaire playboy, industrialist and ingenious engineer, Tony Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in 
which his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates a powered suit of armor to 
save his life and escape captivity. He later uses the suit to protect the world as Iron Man. Through his multinational corporation
 ― Stark Industries ― Tony has created many military weapons, some of which, along with other technological devices of his making, 
 have been integrated into his suit, helping him fight crime. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War 
 themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of 
 Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.

Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been 
featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows 
and films. The character is portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical and 
box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance, reprised the role in Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers
 (2012), and made a cameo appearance in The Incredible Hulk (2008). Downey will play the role once again in the planned Iron Man 3 (2013).
  Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.</p>
