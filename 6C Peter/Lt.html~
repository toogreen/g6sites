   <p style="color: white; ">The Lightning Thief is the first book in the series. It was released on June 28, 2005. A 12 year old demigod named Percy Jackson 
   lives in New York with his mother, Sally Jackson. During a field trip to a museum, Percy is attacked by a Fury disguised as 
   his pre-algebra teacher, Ms. Dodds, and he vaporises her with a sword given to him by Mr. Brunner, his Latin teacher. 
   After Ms. Dodds is killed, no one in his school remembers knowing her. At the end of the school year, Percy heads home and 
   his mother decides to take the two of them on a vacation. Percy's best friend Grover arrives and reveals himself as a satyr 
   (half goat-half man). Percy tells him about Ms. Dodds while his mom races them to Camp Half-Blood (a camp for demigods). 
   While heading to the camp, they are attacked by the minotaur. Percy's mother is taken captive before he can kill the Minotaur. 
   He kills the minotaur and, exausted he passes out. When he wakes, he finds himself in the camp. He meets his former Latin teacher ,
    Mr. Brunner, who turns out to be Chiron (a centaur), and Annabeth Chase (Daughter of Athena). Percy is soon claimed by his Olympian parent,
     Poseidon (god of the Sea). Later on, he is accused of stealing Zeus's lighting bolt. Although Percy insists that he didn't do it, 
     Zeus (King of the gods and lord of the sky) doesn't believe him. 
     And if he doesn't prove Zeus wrong, there will be a massive war between the gods. 
     Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are given a quest to retrieve Zeus' stolen lightning bolt as Zeus believes Percy stole it. 
     After they get the quest, the trio initially believes Hades (god of the Underworld) to be the thief and travel across the United States to Los Angeles, 
     where they know the entrance to the underworld is, facing numerous mythological monsters, including Medusa, Echidna, and the Furies. Then Percy fights Ares (god of War) and retrieves the stolen things. In the end, they learn the real thief was Luke (Son of Hermes), a camper who'd befriended Percy when he first arrived at Camp Half-Blood. Luke stole the bolt to allow Kronos (the Titan Lord) the chance to rise again.

The book has been adapted into a film by Chris Columbus and 20th Century Fox, under the title Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.
