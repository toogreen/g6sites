<div style="text-align: left"><img src="Sasuke.jpeg" width="212" height="300" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000">Sasuke is one of the members from the Uchiha clan from the village of Konohagakure. His whole clan was eliminated by his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life, deeming him as unworthy to kill.Believing Orochimaru will be able to give him the strength needed to kill Itachi, Sasuke goes to him, severing his ties with the village in the process. Naruto follows him in an effort to stop him, and the two do battle. Though he tries to kill Naruto, Sasuke ultimately cannot bring himself to do so, and instead continues on to Orochimaru's hideout. After 2 years, Orochimaru attempts to switch his body with Sasuke, which has improvd his skills rapidly. But gets killed easily by Sasuke. After that he gathers his comrades to defeat Itachi. And succes to kill his older brother. But with himself getting serious injured. He learns a shoking secret from the Akatsuki's leader, Tobi. That eliminating all of the Uchiha clan was a mission from the konoha village, and he spared Sasuke not because he was unworthy to kill, because he was his beloved brother he couldn't kill even if it was a mission. That gave Sasuke a new goal. To kill all of the people in konoha village.</font>
<div style="text-align: left"><img src="Madara.jpeg" width="289" height="300" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000">Madara Uchiha is one of the founders of Konohagakure and the first leader of the Uchiha clan. After losing his eyesight as a result of overusing his Mangekyo Sharingan, Madara had the eyes from his younger brother transplanted to him in order to regain his vision, obtain the Eternal <a href="Jutsu_(Naruto).html">Mangekyo Sharingan</a>, and continue fighting opposing clans. However, Konohagakure's foundation by the Uchihas and the Senjus to end the war makes Madara ultimately leave the village and try to kill the Senjus' leader, the First Hokage Hashirama Senju, controlling the powerful nine-tailed fox, Kurama. Madara is claimed to have died shortly after his defeat, but it is later revealed how he faked it to get a piece of obtain Hashirama's powers, and awoke his Rinnegan before his actual death. During most of the Naruto series, Madara is impersonated by the criminal Tobi until Kabuto Yakushi  finds the real Madara and resurrects him with the first Hokage's genetic sample infused into him. Working on the same goal as Tobi, Madara willingly joins Kabuto to fight against the Shinobi Alliance.</font>
<div style="text-align: left"><img src="itachi.jpeg" width="300" height="299" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000"> He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, establishing milestones for Sasuke and future Uchiha to live up to.[10]  Over time, however, Itachi began to distance himself from the clan, acting hostile towards its members when he is accused of murdering his clansman Shisui Uchiha and prompting his father to discourage Sasuke from following in Itachi's footsteps. Itachi soon afterwards killed every member of the clan with the explanation that he was testing his potential. He spared only Sasuke, who he claimed was too weak to be worth killing, and challenged him to live a life of hate so that he would get strong enough to someday pose a challenge to Itachi. The reasons were later made known in the future. Itachi vanished into the night, leaving Sasuke with the motive for revenge that drives his actions for most of the series. Towards the end of Naruto manga volume forty-three, after Itachi's death, the truth of his background is told by Tobi. Itachi's early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. When years later the Uchiha clan began planning a coup d'Ã©tat to take control of the village of Konohagakure, Itachi feared the attempt would cause another war and became a double agent, providing Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions. The village eventually gave him the mission of assassinating the Uchiha. After the Uchiha were eliminated, Itachi, tormented by his actions, could not bring himself to kill Sasuke too. He made himself out as a villain. To keep Sasuke safe until then, Itachi threatened to share everything he knew about Konoha with its enemies if the village ever harmed Sasuke. In the meantime, he joined the criminal organization Akatsuki to keep an eye on it and Tobi in case they ever conspired against Konoha.</font>
<div style="text-align: left"><img src="kakashi.jpeg" width="300" height="168" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000">Kakashi is revealed to be very famous in the Naruto world, earning him the moniker "Kakashi of the Sharingan" for possessing the Sharingan, an eye technique in his left eye. It grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also created the Lightning Blade, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha.</font>
<div style="text-align: left"><img src="minato.jpeg" width="300" height="225" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000">Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, is the father of Naruto Uzumaki  and spouse to Kushina Uzumaki. Although Naruto and Minato are noted to have a number of similar traits throughout the series, their familial relationship is not revealed until Part II of the series. He was the student of Jiraiya and the teacher of Kakashi Hatake. Minato was a prodigy among ninja, such that enemy villages issued flee-on-sight orders if ever he appeared on a battlefield. He developed a jutsu that was in essence a teleportation jutsu, allowing him to wipe out whole armies in the blink of an eye, thus earning him the title of "Konoha's Yellow Flash". Before the start of the series, he gave his life to seal Kurama, the nine-tailed fox, into Naruto's body, saving Konoha from destruction and giving Naruto access to its great strength.</font>
<div style="text-align: left"><img src="kabuto.jpeg" width="300" height="204" alt="" /></div> <font size="+1" color="#AD0000">Kabuto began acting as a spy for numerous countries and organizations, including the criminal organization Akatsuki. Kabuto uses his various former affiliations as a means to gather intelligence on Orochimaru's behalf; for instance, he participates in the bi-annual ninja exams as a villager of Konohagakure so as to gather information on his fellow participants. Kabuto is highly proficient with medical techniques, being likened in ability to Tsunade: he can regenerate from wounds by reactivating dead cells in order to grow new ones and can form a scalpel with chakra to deal surgical strikes to his opponents using his knowledge of human anatomy. In Part II Kabuto integrates Orochimaru's remains into his body in order to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again. Orochimaru's remains gradually begin to take over his body, but Kabuto expresses desire to kill Sasuke Uchiha, and afterwards settle things with Naruto once he has learned to control the remains. Once mastering Orochimaru's jutsu for summoning the souls of the dead, Kabuto makes his way to Tobi and forms a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win the war against the Shinobi Alliance</font>
