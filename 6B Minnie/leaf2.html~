  <div><p style="font-size:36px;"></p>Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of 20-35 m (66-115 feet), 
  with some specimens in China being over 50 m (164 feet).  The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches,
   and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; 
   the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short
    space of time (1-15 days). A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form aerial roots
     and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500 years old.</div>

<div><p style="font-size:36px;"></p>Ecological environment: in about 500-1000-m acidic soil well drained the natural forest zone.</div>
<div><p style="font-size:36px;"></p>The resource distribution: north from Shenyang, south of Guangzhou, east up east China, southwest
to Guizhou, Yunnan has the cultivation.</div>
<div><p style="font-size:36px;"></p>Extracts of Ginkgo leaves contain flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids (ginkgolides, bilobalides) 
and have been used pharmaceutically. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40â€“200 mg per day. Recently, a meta-analysis 
of clinical trials have shown Ginkgo to be moderately effective in improving cognition in dementia patientsbut not preventing the onset 
of Alzheimer's Disease in normal people.</div>
