		  <div><p style="font-size:30px;">Mentha is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family).
		   The species are not clearly distinct and estimates of the number of species varies from 13 to 18.
		   Hybridization between some of the species occurs naturally. Many other hybrids as well as numerous 
		   cultivars are known in cultivation. The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution across Europe, Africa, 
		   <div><p style="font-size:30px;">The mint leaf has peppermint oil in it, so it could have the same virtue of mint.
The virtue of mint leaf is: diminish inflammation, relieve itching
Improve bad cold, headache, toothache and invigorating.
How to use it: we could use mint leaf to make tea, cook congee or put some when we cook, we could put the mint leaf in our pillow too!
The smile: we always use the mint in toothpaste and chewing, because the smile of mint could make our tone become pure and fresh. 
But donâ€™t use too much or you would feel peppery-some bad toothpaste use too many mint leaf so when we use it too brash teeth we 
would feel peppery.</div>
