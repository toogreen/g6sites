  <div><p style="font-size:36px;">Maple leaf</div>

<div><p style="font-size:30px;">Most maples are trees growing to 10 – 45 meters (30 – 145 ft) in height. Others are shrubs 
less than 10 meters tall with a number of small trunks originating at ground level. 
Most species are deciduous, but a few in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are
 evergreen. Most are shade-tolerant when young and are often late-successional in ecology; 
 many of the root systems are typically dense and fibrous. A few species, notably Acer cappadocicum, 
 frequently produce root sprouts, which can develop into clonal colonies.
Maples are variously classified in a family of their own, the Aceraceae, or together with 
the Hippocastanaceae included in the family Sapindaceae. Modern classifications, including 
the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system, favour inclusion in Sapindaceae. The type species of the genus 
is Acer pseudoplatanus (Sycamore maple).</div>


<div><p style="font-size:30px;">There are approximately 128 species, most of which are native to Asia, 
with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and North America. 
Only one species, the poorly studied Acer laurinum, is native to the Southern Hemisphere. 
Fifty-four species of maples meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria 
for being under threat of extinction in their native habitat.</div>
