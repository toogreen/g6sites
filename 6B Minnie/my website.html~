 (Shanghai United International School), our school is a school which is 'east meet west'.
 I'm 12 years old and my class is 6B.I made this website because our ICT project.This website is about leaf.Leaf is a very important but people
 don' care it very much. I think after you see my website, you would have a new idea of leaf!
