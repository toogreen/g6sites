<p style="color: black; ">Hello there, I am the author of this supersticious website. I'm not really a superstitious person, but I love to read about it, and that's what<br>
drove me to write this. Now, lets talk about me, my name is Rebecca Maria Vittoria Rovescala and I am 11 years old. I am in 6th grade right now.<br>
I live in a medium sized family with my sister and my brother(both younger than me), my mom and my dad.I am Italian and half Chinese but i live in<br>
China. My favorite animals are Golden Retrievers, Chestnut horses, all kinds of wild cats, wolves, eagles and tabby kittens. My favorite flowers<br>
are sunflowers, daisies, tiger lillies and blue bellflowers. My favorite colors are purple, black, aquamarine, white, lavender and baby pink.<br>
I am a Sagittarius, born on the 11th of December. My best friends are Lydia, Ling Li and Xiao Meng. Be sure to check out their websites too!</p><br>
