 <p>This is Sheldon Cooper! He is in a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler,
  they met in a cafe and were matched by a dating site.</p>
 <p>He is obviously a freaking genius. He has super memory and always
  wins in card games.</p> Sheldon liked Star Trek and collecting 
 comic books and collectible action figures. He can speak really
  quickly and was said to be in college at age 10!</p>

<p>Now you are meeting Leonard Hofstader. He unlike Sheldon, comes from a family of brainiacs so a lot is expected from him.</p>
<p>He has an on and off relationship with Penny and is one of or is the most un-socially awkward member of the group.</p>
<p>He is also very smart and shares many interets with his roomate Sheldon. They all hang out in the comic book shop a lot.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<p> Say hi to Howard Wolowitz! He is currently married to Bernadette. Howard is a Jew and lives with his mother.</p>
<p> Hes has a history of liking all women which once made Bernadette pretty mad. He apologized and said stuff to her 
that was very touching. It made me cry! LOL.</p>
<p> Howard is an engineer and it the latest episode he is going in the rocket at the end.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<img border="0" src="Raj.jpg" alt="raj" width="304" height="300" align="left" />
<p>This guy is Rajesh Koothrappali AKA Raj. He is probably the most socially awkward because of his fear of women. 
Raj can only speak to them when he is drunk or ate drugs. He is currently single.</p>
<p> He comes from India and also likes comic books and stuff.</p>
<p> More on him dating: He gets lucky sometimes at parties and latest short-time girlfriend was a deaf girl
and had Howard help him with the sign language.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<img border="0" src="penny.jpg" alt="penny" width="304" height="300" align="left" />
<p>Now you're meeting the girl gang! Penny, the most social and leader like girl of the group has dated
a lot of men and has an on and off thing with Leonard.</p>
<p>She was pretty stupid in the beginning but learned so much from the guys!</p>
<p>Penny is an actress but hasn't had many oppurtunities yet. She is also a waitress at the Cheesecake
factory where the guys eat once a week, I think on Tuesdays.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<img border="0" src="amy.jpg" alt="amy" width="304" height="300" align="left" />
<p>Who's this gal? She's Amy Farrah Fowler! She is in a relationship with Sheldon Cooper and is
also very smart. Like a female version of him. Hehe.</p>
<p>Even though she is with Sheldon she sometimes makes comments that are "too far" on Penny. It's probably
just her way of being Penny's best friend.</p>
<p> Amy Farrah Fowler likes spending time with Sheldon very much and lately had an experiment to make
him like her more.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
