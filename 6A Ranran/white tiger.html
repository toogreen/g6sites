  Cats are similar in anatomy  to the other felids, 
with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes,
sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing 
small prey. As crepuscular  predators, cats use their 
acute hearing and ability to see in near darkness to 
locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint
for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in 
frequency  than humans can perceive. This is because
 the usual prey of cats (particularly rodents such 
 as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing 
 of the cat has evolved to pinpoint these faint 
 high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better 
 sense of smell than humans.

The modern white tiger population includes both pure 
 Bengals and hybrid Bengalâ€“Siberians, however, it is unclear whether the 
 recessive white gene came only from Bengals, or if it also originated from 
 Siberian ancestors.
