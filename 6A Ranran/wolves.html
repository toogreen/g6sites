The gray wolf, grey wolf, or common wolf
(Canis lupus) is the largest extant member
of the dog family of mammals, the Canidae.
Though once abundant over much of Eurasia,
North Africa and North America, the gray 
wolf inhabits a reduced portion of its 
former range due to widespread destruction
 of its habitat, human encroachment, and
the resulting human-wolf encounters 
that sparked broad extirpation.

 Although
the species still faces some threats, 
it is relatively widespread with a stable
population trend and has therefore been 
assessed as Least Concern by IUCN since 2004.
Today, wolves are protected in some areas,
hunted for sport in others, or may be subject
to population control or extermination as threats
to livestock, people, and pets. They occur 
primarily but not exclusively in wilderness 
and remote areas.
