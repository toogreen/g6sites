 Dogs perform many
roles for people, such as hunting, herding,
pulling loads, protection, assisting 
police and military, companionship, and,
more recently, aiding handicapped 
individuals. This impact on human 
society has given them the nickname 
"Man's Best Friend" in the Western world.
In some cultures, dogs are also source of
meat.In 2001, there were estimated
to be 400 million dogs in the world.
