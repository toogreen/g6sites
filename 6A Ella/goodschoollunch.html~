 <h1>IT THIS WHT YOU FEEL???</h1>
 <h3>You're sitting in class and your stomach is starting to rumble. Finally, the bell rings and it's time
  for lunch — woo-hoo! After all that time in class, you deserve a chance to head to the cafeteria and sit
   down, relax, and enjoy the company of your friends over a lunchtime meal.
<br>
<p>
But wait a minute — what exactly are you eating?
<br>
<p>
More than at other meals, kids have a lot of control over what they eat for lunch at school. 
A kid can choose to eat the green beans or throw them out. A kid also can choose to eat an apple
 instead of an ice cream sandwich.
<br><p>
When choosing what to eat for lunch, making a healthy choice is really important. Here's why: Eating
 a variety of healthy foods gives you energy to do stuff, helps you grow the way you should, and can
  even keep you from getting sick.
<br><p>
Think of your school lunch as the fuel you put in your tank. If you choose the wrong kind of fuel,
 you might run out of energy before the day is over.
<br><p>
So what is the right kind of fuel? What does a healthy lunch look like? Unlike that killer question
 on your math test, there are many right answers to these questions.</h3>
