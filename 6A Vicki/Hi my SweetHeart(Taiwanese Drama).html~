Xue Hai (Show Luo) is a dork who comes from a wealthy family and had been protected by his oldest sister, Xue Bo for most of his life. 
At age 20, he decided to move out of his comfort zone and study abroad in Hangzhou. 
To protect his identity as the heir of his family's wealth, Xue Bo, gave him a new name "Lin Da Lang." 
Who is supposed to be a poor student.
<br><br>
At Zhejiang University, Da Lang meets Chen Bao Zhu (Rainie Yang).
Lin Da Lang becomes good friends with the nasty Chen Bao Zhu.
Unaware of Lin Da Lang's background, Bao Zhu teaches him the norms and social baby steps of every day life. 
As she begins to drop her guard, Da Lang vows to always be with her, and they fall in love.
<br><br> 
During this time, Chen Bao Zhu's father goes bankrupt and flees, leaving her and her mother behind.
Using Bao Zhu's father as an example of poverty and failure, Bao Zhu's mother refuses to accept Lin Da Lang's relationship with her daughter and orders her to break up with Da Lang or she will prevent his graduation. 
Out of fear for Da Lang, Bao Zhu lies to her mother in a note, and agrees to an arranged marriage.
Secretly, Bao Zhu plans to elope with Da Lang.
<br><br>
On Bao Zhu's birthday, Da Lang and Chen Bao Zhu make plans to meet.
Da Lang purchases an engagement ring and heads to their meeting spot. 
But as Chen Bao Zhu leaves to meet Lin Da Lang, she is hit by a car and knocked unconscious for months. 
Da Lang continued to wait, but she never showed.
Worried, Da Lang later visits her home, and Chen Bao Zhu's mother lies to him and tells him that she is in Europe and will soon marry someone else, showing him the note Bao Chu left.
Not knowing Bao Zhu's true intentions, Da Lang comes to the conclusion that he was recklessly abandoned by his first love. 
Xue Hai stops being Da Lang and vows not to ever have a proper relationship again. 
After 3 years....( That is how the story will go on)
