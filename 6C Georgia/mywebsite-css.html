	<div style="magin-left: 350px; magin-right: 350px; margin-top: -200px; "><center><div><h2>Jun Sakurada</h2>
The protagonist, Jun is at first a secluded boy, who refuses to go back to school because 
of a traumatic experience (hikikomori): After living with Shinku and the other Rozen Maidens, and 
experiencing their own struggles, he has a change of attitude. He thinks at first that the dolls
are pests though.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; "><h2>Nori Sakurada</h2>She is Jun's older sister. In the absence of both of their parents,
who work abroad, Nori takes care of the household. She does the laundry, and in general tends 
to Jun and the Rozen Maidens living with them, without getting too involved in their affairs and
 battles. She likes making tea, which is just as well as Shinku has a penchant for it.</div>
 <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; "><h2>Suigintou</h2>The first Rozen Maiden, she had a flaw in her design in the anime.
 Despite this, her love for their father and will to live are so strong that she can walk
 and use her powers without a human "medium". She holds a special hatred towards Shinku 
 because of events in their past. In the anime, Suigintou was the primary antagonist of
 the first season. Her abilities involve using the feathers of her wings as weapons, and
 she also has a hidden ability of shifting her life force into any nearby human.</div>
 <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; margin-top: 500px; "><h2>Kanaria</h2>The second Rozen Maiden, she is childish and eccentric, becoming
  a perfect complement for Hinaichigo. In the anime, Kanaria was introduced only in the 
  second season, Träumend. Her powers come from her skills with the violin.</div>
  <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; "><h2>Suiseiseki</h2>The third Rozen Maiden, and Souseiseki's delicate twin.
   She and Souseiseki are both referred to as "gardeners" for their ability to
   communicate and tend to plants, but also to the "soul trees" of humans. Notable
   in the original Japanese language, Suiseiseki ends every sentence with the word
   desu, making her a well-known character for this trait.In the manga, Suiseiseki
   says "yes" at the end of most sentences. In addition, she is depicted with 
   heterochromia, her right eye red, and her left eye green, with the same colors
   but on opposite eyes for Souseiseki. She has the power to enter people's dreams
   and create vines and trees with her water can. She has a deep hatred of humans.</div>
   <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; margin-top: 350px; "><h2>Souseiseki</h2>The fourth Rozen Maiden, and Suiseiseki's twin. Souseiseki
   is sharp in her speech and a good fighter, much like Shinku. Unlike Shinku, however,
   Souseiseki has short hair, wears not a dress but trousers, and uses masculine forms
   in her speech (notable in the original Japanese language), making her more of a 
   tomboy. In addition, her left eye is red and her right eye is green, much like
   Suiseiseki. She can enter people's dreams and cut through solid objects with her 
   scissors. At the end of Träumend, Souseiseki is defeated by Suigintou (Or Sugintoh,
   to mention her true name) and falls from the Alice Game.</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; "><h2>Shinku</h2>The fifth Rozen Maiden, she is the main protagonist of the dolls.
	 Shinku first makes a bond with Jun when he is attacked by a possessed doll. Then,
	 Shinku is perceived as bossy and cold, but she is actually very protective of Jun
	 and the other dolls. After living long enough, Shinku has become a pacifist and
	 doesn't like fighting her sisters. Nevertheless, she is a good fighter, being 
	 able to fight back the ruthless Suigintou when she needs to. Her powers manifest
	 by releasing rose petals out of her hands.</div>
	 <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; margin-top: 500px; "><h2>Hinaichigo</h2>The sixth Rozen Maiden, she is quite childish and naïve,
	  and is not much of a fighter. Hinaichigo has the best intentions for those that 
	  she cares about, and she is specially fond of Nori, and her cooking. Her powers 
	  work by creating strawberry vines from the ground. She is not strong, but to
	  Suigintou she is a pest. In the manga, her body is consumed by the seventh doll,
	  Kirakishou. In the anime, she is defeated by Shinku. Hinaichigo stops working 
	  after Souseiseki loses to Sugintou, entrusting her Rosa Mystica to Shinku.</div>
	  <div style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; "><h2>Kirakishou</h2>The seventh Rozen Maiden, she does not possess a physical
	   body and only exists in the "N-Field"[clarification needed]. Because of this,
	   she consumes Hinaichigo and uses her body to step into the real world, becoming 
	   a major threat to the other dolls. In the anime, she was only shown briefly at
	   the very end of the second season, Träumend, and she was not even called by name. 
	   In Träumend, which follows a story different from the manga, another doll,
	   Barasuishou, poses as the seventh doll, and is the main antagonist.</div></center></div>
