<p style="color: #FFFFFF; ">My dog's name is Coco, she is a really cut dog. I got her when I'm 
seven but now I need to give her away because we are going to America and she can't get on a plane.
My mom decided to give her to Pamela, a responsible woman who could take good care of Coco, good luck, Coco!</p>
