Water, Water, Water!

There's no compromise here... make sure your dog always has fresh, clean drinking water each and every day.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFFFF; ">Dry dog food of a good quality (and/or properly prepared homemade dog food) is often considered the best 
food for dogs. [Note: Fresh meat alone will not provide adequate dog nutrition.] Leftover vegetables and 
meat scraps can be added to dry food for variation in texture.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFFFF; ">Make sure your dog gets hard dog biscuits (and in some cases, raw bones) included in his diet. Feeding your 
dog only soft food, will lead to plaque build-up on his teeth.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFFFF; ">Ensure your puppy's dietary needs are met by introducing them to 'solid' food as they are being weaned.
 Any new foods should be brought in gradually so as not to upset the young stomach. Special puppy canned 
 and dry food is available. Note: Puppies will need to be fed a few times a day until six months old, then
  twice a day until they are twelve months old. After that, you may only need to feed your dog once a day.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFFFF; ">Do not feed your dog excess amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Also avoid feeding your dog scraps directly
 from the dinner table. This can lead to overweight canines!</p>
