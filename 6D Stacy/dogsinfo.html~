<p>Dogs are used by humans for many different things, for work and as 
pets. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, 
and listen to humans. Dogs are like people. This is because dogs have 
jobs. Just like we have police people, army people (commonly known as 
soldiers), and firemen, dog jobs include police dog, army dog, seeing eye 
dog, fire dog, messenger dog, and much more.</p>
