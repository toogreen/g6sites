<p align="center" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-family: teal; ">Hello there! Welcome to my web page ABOUT ME!!</p>
<p align="left" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-family: teal; ">Hi! My name is Stacy Chen, [Remember, Stacy is spelt 
without an "e"]I am an American Chinese...(I know it's weird, It's just that my nationality is USA, but my whole 
family is pure Chinese) Well first, I want to thank you for visiting my website, now I am going to introduce myself.
 I am born on the 17th of December,1999. So...now, I'm 12 yrs of age. I'm studying in sixth grade, and this website 
 is for my ICT assignment!(And now I'm spending all the time typing in the paragragh tag!). I am an Animal lover, I 
 love dogs, birds, dolphins and bunnies! I love to be with nature, because I can express myself instead of being 
 someone I'm not-say anything, do anything, lay on the grass and watch the clouds flow past...But I never had chance
  to do that. I live in a crowded city called Shanghai, this city is polluted but has ALOT of things to do,I love 
  shopping with my cousins and playing with my dog. My dog's name is Coco, she is a "HuDie Quan"(in Chinese), she is
   cute with white and brown patterns but she is now old. Now she is a happy dog, but this won't last long, because
    I am going to USA for a living and not coming back anymore. So that means I have to give her to someone else, 
    which is soooooo sad. The place in US I'm going to is Illinois, Peoria. There is my friend, Alvina, I can't 
    wait to see her! I am going to a public school in the US,I am so excited! <a href="autobiograghy.html" style="color: #00FF00; ">Click Here</a>
