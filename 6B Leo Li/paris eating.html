<h1>Paris Eating</h1>

<h2>Although France is famous for its wines, this country has deep traditions and a rich history for fine French cuisine with specialities 
from many different regions and gastronomy is taken very seriously, especially in Paris where you will find some of the finest chefs in the
 World.

You will find that there are thousands of different cafes and restaurants in Paris alone, which will range from the small traditional bistro 
such as the Allard Bistro but there are also restaurants that range right up to top table and haute cuisine.

Even at a small traditional bistro style restaurant like the Boeuf sur le Toit or at a fancy restaurant setting such as the Train Bleu, 
the quality of food will be of the utmost of importance and what people come back for, time after time, 
but many places have to be booked prior and some places require reservations even weeks in advance to ensure you can get a table</h2>
